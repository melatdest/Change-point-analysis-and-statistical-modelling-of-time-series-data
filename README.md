# Tasks Completed
# Task 1: Understanding the Data and Model
1. Defined the data analysis workflow, outlining steps and processes.

2. Researched and understood time series models like ARIMA, GARCH, and LSTM for forecasting.

3. Identified key assumptions and limitations in the analysis.

4. Determined relevant media channels for communicating results to stakeholders.
# Task 2: Data Analysis and Modeling
1. Applied statistical and econometric models such as:

2. ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)

3. GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity)

4. Vector Autoregression (VAR) for multivariate time series analysis

5. Markov-Switching ARIMA for capturing different market regimes

6. LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for deep learning-based forecasting

7. Investigated the impact of economic indicators, technological advancements, and political factors on oil prices.

8. Integrated macroeconomic data such as GDP, inflation rates, and unemployment.

9. Conducted model validation using historical data to test predictive accuracy
 
# Task 3: Interactive Dashboard Development
